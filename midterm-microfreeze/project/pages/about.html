		<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
				The Micro-Freeze is an appliance just like your conventional microwave. However, instead of making items HOT, it makes them COLD.  
			</p>

			<h2>For What?</h2>
			<p>
				The possibilities for the Micro-Freeze are endless. Regardless, here is a list of some practical uses:
				
				<ul>
					<li>You already enjoy hot, freshly-popped popcorn with the microwave. Now, you can do the same with homemade ice cream</li>
					<li>Chilled wine and cold beer in an instant.</li>
					<li>Flash-freeze prepared foods for unparalleled freshness when reheated.</li>
					<li>Skip the line at Starbucks and enjoy an iced coffee from the comfort of your home.</li>
					<li>Never burn your mouth again! Now you don't have to wait for hot soup to cool</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>How?</h2>
			<p>
				Conventional microwaves heat food by exciting its molecules until they reach an agitated state. This makes the molecules move faster and collide into each other, creating energy in the form of heat. The Micro-Freeze does the exact opposite. Using high-speed fans and pressurized CO2 gas found in dry ice, the Micro-Freeze drastically reduces the temperature of the food, polarizing its molecules until they slow down to a cooled state, or stop all together to remain frozen.
